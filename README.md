## Introduction

This is the README file for the OnlineDilerV3 project. OnlineDilerV3 is a small-scale online store system written in Go. This README provides an overview of the project's code structure, its purpose, and how to set it up for development or deployment.

## Code Overview

The project's code is organized into a package named `handler`. Here's a brief description of the main components and their functionality:

- **Handler**: The `Handler` struct is responsible for handling incoming HTTP requests and routing them to the appropriate functions. It uses the Gin web framework.

- **NewHandler**: This function creates a new instance of the `Handler` struct and initializes it with the provided `service.Service`.

- **InitRouts**: This method initializes the routes and middleware for the web application using Gin. It defines various API endpoints for user authentication, product management, category management, user management, consignment management, discount management, and order management.

- **CORSMiddleware**: This function implements Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) middleware to handle cross-origin requests.
